# Awesome Project ft Peta
A React Native app per Pluralsight course by Adhithi Ravi. [Here is the actual project's repo.](https://github.com/adhithiravi/React-Native-Component-Playbook)

These files may look a little different. To use them:

1. First start with Adhithi's actual work (before code) - give the actual course a look too if you can
2. Replace the project's relevant files with these ones (no major differences with after code)
3. Run `npm i`
4. Open an Android emulator or get your device ready
5. Run `npx react-native run-android`

That's about it ðŸ¤”
